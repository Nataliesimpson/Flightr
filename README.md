# Flightr
Flight &amp; hotel comparison app using APIs &amp; vanilla Javascript

Group project: We created a flight & hotel comparison app called Flightr.

- Users can input travel dates & the app returns suggested travel packages, initially ordered by price.
- Flightr uses geolocation to determine the users current position and automatically links this to the nearest airport.
- The user is able to change the departure airport if they are not travelling from nearest airport.
- Both the Skyscanner & Expedia API were used to provide the flights & hotel data.
- Holiday packages can be filtered further by star/guest rating, percentage recommended.

- User experience & the customer journey were important throughout this project as well as the look and feel of the app.
- They were kept at the forefront of the design & developemtn process through extensive planning, wireframes & personas.
